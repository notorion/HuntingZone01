+<html><body>Ivory Tower Investigator:<br>
+We were researching the source of the power of the Nephilim and Lilim. But what was creating a space where time mixed occurred, and future was a rarity in time. And the problem was that from it these past Nephilim and Lilim, who had disappeared in the past, reappeared in the Catacombs and the Necropolis. If left like this, time refilt will expand further, and the number of Nephilim and Lilim will increase, causing great confusion. Please help us! <BR> By talking to Gatekeeper Ziggurat next to me, you can go to the Catacombs of the Necropolis where monsters appeared.
